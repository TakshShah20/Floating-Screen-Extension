# Floating-Screen-Extension
A Google Chrome Extension which facilitates a floating screen to its users.
This extension has been developed using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

*OBJECTIVE:*

Everyone experiences this difficulty wherein they’d like to multi-task between two applications/websites etc. But they would need to switch between those applications as they’ll be running in the background, which is where this extension becomes useful. Users will be able to apply it on majority of the websites, thereby making it a very convenient tool which provides easy control over websites.

*SCOPE:*

This extension will allow users to choose between 3 formats: one for videos, the other for pdfs, and the last for simply displaying the entire website in a floating screen. The floating screen will always remain on top. Mind well that always on top doesn’t mean at top “position”, position can be anywhere as per the users’ desire. This will help users to simultaneously work on different things. However, in case of video streaming websites whose security policies do not allow us to use their content, will be an exception to our extension.

*Comparison with existing applications:*

There may be a few such extensions available out there which facilitate a floating screen to its users, however, those are restricted to a particular website only. They may work only for a specific website. Whereas this extension works for multiple websites, and it even works for pdfs and videos. This extension allows users to open multiple floating screens simultaneously, each having either a website, a video or a pdf open in them. On top of this, all these floating screens shall always remain in the foreground, i.e, on opening multiple floating screens, the previously opened screens won’t be shifted in the background like it happens in case of android applications. Instead, all of the screens remain on top, thereby allowing easy access to each of them and thereby making it a suitable tool for multi-tasking.
